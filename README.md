# 3DSymmetryObjects


This repository contains the STL files for 3D printable objects used to teach group theory in an undergraduate inorganic chemistry course. Each object is easily printable using a fused deposition modeling (FDM) printers, and I have found they all print well *without* the need for supports, adhesion layers, skirts, or any post-processing. Objects belong to a range of point groups including D_<sub>nd</sub>, D_{nh}, D_n C_{nv}, C_{nh}, C_n, S_n, C_1, C_s, C_i, O_h, I_h, and T_d.
