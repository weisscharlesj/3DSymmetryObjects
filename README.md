# 3DSymmetryObjects


This repository contains the STL files for 3D printable objects used to teach group theory in an undergraduate inorganic chemistry course. Each object is easily printable using a fused deposition modeling (FDM) printers, and I have found they all print well *without* the need for supports, adhesion layers, skirts, or any post-processing. Objects belong to a range of point groups including D<sub>nd</sub>, D<sub>nh</sub>, D<sub>n</sum>, C<sub>nv</sub>, C<sub>nh</sub>, C<sub>n</sub>, S<sub>n</sub>, C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>s</sub>, C<sub>i</sub>, O<sub>h</sub>, I<sub>h</sub>, and T<sub>d</sub>.
